Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in a joint international agreement between
[Sapienza University](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) in Rome (Italy) and
[York University](https://www.yorku.ca/index.html) in Toronto (Canada). I belong to the
[WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io) research group.

My supervisors are [Giuseppe De Giacomo](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/degiacom/) and
[Yves Lesp√©rance](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~lesperan/).

#### Research

I mainly work in the area of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Formal Methods**. In particular,
my research interests are on Liner-time Temporal Logics on Finite Traces, Reasoning about Actions, Planning, and 
Explainability for autonomous systems.

#### Tools
I am the author of several tools, most of them are hosted on the [WhiteMech GitHub](https://github.com/whitemech). 
The three main research tools are [LTL<sub>f</sub>2DFA](http://ltlf2dfa.diag.uniroma1.it),
[FOND4LTL<sub>f</sub>](https://fond4ltlf.herokuapp.com/), and 
[Plan4Past](https://github.com/whitemech/planning-for-past-temporal-goals).

#### Teaching
During 2019 and 2020, I have been TA for several undergraduate courses at York University, including EECS1021, EECS1022, 
EECS2021, and EECS2030.
